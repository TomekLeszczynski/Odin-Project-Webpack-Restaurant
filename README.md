# Conclusions & Issues

- Small project but fully loaded of new and really helpful elements like webpack, ES6 modules. Webpack.config.js created with YT tutorial - need to study more how to manage modules, plugins, etc.
- Styles could be in one file only but wanted to test @use rule in sass and how it behaves during webpack bundling.
